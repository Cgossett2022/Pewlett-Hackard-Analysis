# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
1. For this project, I used SQL to build an Employee Database for Pewlett Hackard. Since a large number of employees will be retiring over the next few years, the company needs to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

2. In order to build the database, I used Quick DBD to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for all the CSV data files.
